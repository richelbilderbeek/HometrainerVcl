## Simple example of Hometrainer in creating exercises

Supply the program with a text file like shown below (note that the first line is obligatory):

```

Humanbody.bmp,Which line points to the liver?,1,2,3,4
Humanbody.bmp,Which line points to the liver?,1/one/One
Humanbody.bmp,Which organ does line 1 point to?,The liver/the liver/Liver/liver
-,In which organ is ethanol detoxified?,The liver/the liver/Liver/liver
```

The program will show you the image, the question and the (shuffled) answers. You have to click the right answer. Great to train yourself in nearly anything!
